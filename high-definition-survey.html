        <h1>LiDAR Mapping/High Definition Survey</h1>
        <p>High-definition surveying/ LiDAR mapping is a terrestrial non-intrusive means of collecting detailed and accurate as-built data. Based on the latest, cutting-edge technology, high-definition scanning uses a narrow laser beam to "sweep across" a target object, so that hundreds of thousands of closely spaced measurements can be taken in a matter of minutes. When these scanned measurements are displayed on a computer, an intense representation point cloud of the target results which can be viewed and navigated much like a 3D model.</p>
<p>High definition scanning and laser 3D scanning services are revolutionizing the industry. In the land surveying field, high-definition survey techniques offer an added measure of safety to surveyors who may need to capture data on heavily traveled highways. Our digital output assures that complete and accurate as-builts can be provided more quickly-and at lower cost-than traditional land surveying techniques. In brief, high-definition survey is a tried and genuine way to make a positive impact on a project's bottom line.</p>
<p>Recent technological advances make high definition land surveys the most cost-effective and time-sensitive solution for providing the highest level of detail available. This scanning service makes data available to a variety of disciplines, such as planning, engineering, and construction to name a few. In addition, it offers the advantages of improved worker safety, higher accuracy of survey data, and rapid project turnaround.</p>
