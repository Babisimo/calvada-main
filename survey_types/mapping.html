        <p>Calvada Surveying provides mapping services of all types in order to meet our clients’ needs for future development. Nearly all development requires some sort of mapping before the local agency will approve the project. This includes private property owners building on their land, selling a portion of land, or developers creating large subdivisions.</p>
<p>Our firm has experience on projects of all sizes. Whether you need to adjust the location of an existing lot line, merge multiple parcels together, or create a large number of lots on which to develop, Calvada Surveying can take care of all your mapping needs.</p>
