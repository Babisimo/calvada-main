          <h1>Boundary Surveys</h1>
          <p>
            Boundary surveys are performed to locate and mark the property
            corners of a client's property. This information can be used by the
            property owner to identify any encroachments on the property or to
            ensure that walls and fences are built in the correct location.
          </p>

          <p>
            We begin the process by acquiring all necessary documents for
            research, review, and pre-calculations. A field crew then mobilizes
            to search for existing monumentation in the surrounding area and
            provide survey measurements to complement our boundary
            determination. Our office staff analyzes the field data and record
            information to determine the boundary location. The field crew
            remobilizes to set the property corners and a Record of Survey is
            prepared to provide proof of our work. At the time of project
            completion, our clients are provided survey monuments in the ground
            at each property corner as well as a Record of Survey that has been
            filed at the office of the County Surveyor.
          </p>

          <p>
            Calvada Surveying prides itself on providing high quality boundary
            mapping services. Our clients can proceed with confidence knowing
            that their property corners are located accurately. Should any
            boundary questions arise in the future, they can produce the
            provided map as proof that a survey was performed to identify the
            limits of their property.
