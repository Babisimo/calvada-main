        <h1>Topographic Surveys</h1>
        <p>Topographic surveys are performed to identify the existing conditions of a site. This includes contours and the locations and elevations of all improvements. Topographic surveys are used by many professionals in their evaluation and design including engineers, developers, architects, and telecommunication providers. Topographic surveys are the starting point for almost all land development and site improvement work.</p>
 <p>Our surveyors visit the site and begin by establishing horizontal and vertical control that will be used as the basis of all future work. They locate all surface improvements including buildings, curbs, sidewalks, gutters, driveways, handicap ramps, walls, fences, trees, slopes, above ground utilities, and any other improvements that exist on site. Observations are taken at regular intervals in open spaces for the generation of surface contours. Underground pipe invert elevations are measured at all drain inlets, storm drain manholes, and sewer manholes</p>
 <p>The field data is post-processed by our office staff to provide a high-quality drawing in AutoCAD Civil 3D showing all of the information collected by the field crew. Exhibits are prepared in PDF format that provide a clean and precise visual of the site’s existing conditions.</p>
 <p>Calvada Surveying has earned a great reputation for providing thorough topographic surveys of the highest quality in the industry. We are trusted by many engineering firms, developers, and municipalities as their source of topographic surveys from which they perform all of their design.
